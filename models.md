## AI-Based Exoplanet Detection from Stellar Light Curves

**Research Internship – GMU NASA Data Science Program**

**Description:**  
Applied machine learning–style data analysis and signal processing techniques to time-series stellar light curve data from NASA’s TESS mission. Extracted and analyzed temporal features from astronomical signals to identify candidate exoplanets, validating results through ground-based observations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Processed large-scale time-series datasets using Python and AstroImageJ  
- Extracted signal features from stellar light curves for candidate classification  
- Performed data validation and noise filtering on real scientific datasets  
- Co-authored a 10-page research paper under faculty mentorship  

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Python, AstroImageJ, time-series analysis, data preprocessing, scientific visualization
